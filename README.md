### Personal Profile Page

The 1st project of 12 in the TreeHouse Front End Web Development TechDegree

In this project I'll customize a web page to create a personal profile page. I'll modify the HTML and CSS for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and CSS. I'll put my finished project on GitHub, a website used by programmers and teams of programmers to share and work on their code.
