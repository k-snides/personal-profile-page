        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I earned an advanced diploma in Internet Applications and Web Development at St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          The curriculum was originally a 3 year program but I opted to take the 2 year fast track version. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I also received a "Certifiate of Academic Distinction" in recognition of achieving a cumulative 4.0 program grade point average.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently working on a few projects. Those projects are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Bootcamp website</li>
          <li>An Auto Repair website</li>
          <li>My own personal website</li>
          <li>This project...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This simple project is the first project of twelve in the Front End Web Development TechDegree program offered from TreeHouse. I registered for the TechDegree to help me build a portfolio to show to potential clients and employers.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Projects</h2>
        <p>
          What excites me about web design and development is, that if you have an idea or a dream, you can bring it to life.        </p>
        <p>
          My problem is right now I have too many ideas and too many other things to work on at the moment. But if that's a problem, I guess it's a good one to have. I'm sure some of my ideas will appear on GitHub sometime in the future so stay tuned.
